Under Construction, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
===

The aeron-archiver is an application which enables data stream recording and replay support from an archive. 
Currently implemented functionality is limited to the following:
- **Record:** service can record a particular subscription, described
by <__channel, streamId__>. Each resulting image for the subscription
will be recorded under a new __recordingId__.

- **Replay:** service can replay a recorded __recordingId__ from
a particular __termId + termOffset__, and for a particular length.

- **Query:** service provides a rudimentary query interface which
allows __recordingId__ discovery and description.

Protocol
=====
Messages are specified using SBE under `../aeron-archiver-codecs`. The
Archiver communicates via the following interfaces:
 - **Notifications channel:** other parties can subscribe to the notifications
 to track the creation/termination/progress of archives. These are the
 notification messages specified in the codec.
 - **Requests channel:** this allows clients to initiate replay or queries
 interactions with the archiver. Requests have a correlationId sent
 on the initiating request. The `correlationId` is expected to be managed by
 the clients and is offered as a means for clients to track multiple
 concurrent requests. A request will typically involve the
 archiver sending data back on the reply channel specified by the client 
 on the `ConnectRequest` message.

Persisted Format
=====
The Archiver is backed by 3 file types, all of which are expected to reside in the __archiveDir__.

 -  **Catalog (one per archive):** The catalog contains fixed length (4k) records of recording descriptors. The 
 descriptors can be queried as described above. Each descriptor is 4k aligned, and the __recordingId__
 is a simple sequence, which means lookup is a straight dead reconning operation. See the codec
 fo full descriptor details.
 - **Recording Metadata (one per recorded stream):** This is a duplicate of the data kept in the catalog, but the file
 is memory mapped and updated on the go while recording.
 - **Recording Segment Data (many per recorded stream):** This is where the recorded data is kept.
